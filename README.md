# Penucia
A simple front-end app that tells us where we are, where we'd like to be regarding our penuciary lives. 

## This front-end website hopes to:
1. Catalogue information regarding finances, such as 
	1. (Almost) every transaction from all bank accounts
	2. Budget plans for the following year
and display them in a visual manner, for the following goals

	1. Have a clear purpose for all money.
	2. Enable systematic money allotment, saving and spending

2. Commodity Pricing
	1. To be thought about later...
